# Zoom Sucks

* Zoom abuses the installer flow on MacOS to bypass permissions dialogs ([source](https://twitter.com/c1truz_/status/1244737672930824193))
* Zoom sends identifying device info to Facebook, even when users don't have a Facebook account ([source](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/k7e599/zoom-ios-app-sends-data-to-facebook-even-if-you-dont-have-a-facebook-account)) ([fixed](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z3b745/zoom-removes-code-that-sends-data-to-facebook))
* A bug in Zoom sent identifying information (including email addresses and profile pictures) of thousands of users to strangers ([source](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/k7e95m/zoom-leaking-email-addresses-photos))
* Zoom devices (such as smart cameras and tablets) downloaded unsigned firmware updates over HTTP, leaving them vulnerable to man in the middle attacks ([source](https://twitter.com/lrvick/status/1243640724173848578)) (fixed)
